"""
A demonstration of the hindsight instruction relabeling techinque discussed in the AMAGO paper -
a generalization of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to sequences of multiple goals.
The ability to relabel data is another good reason to prefer off-policy RL^2 to on-policy.

This example uses the "MazeRunner" environment. MazeRunner is an adapted version of Memory Maze 
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13383) that does not require the DM Lab simulator or learning from pixels.
For more information please refer to the AMAGO Appendix C.4.

There are three steps to using hindsight relabeling:

1. Make the env's observations a dict with keys for the intended goal and alternative goals achieved
   at that timestep. Goals are often subsets of the state space. In this example, observations consist of:
   
   `obs` : the regular observation from the maze environment (LIDAR-ish depth sensors to the walls, timer, etc.)
   `goals` : a sequence of k goal positions to navigate to.
   `achieved`: the agent's current position.

2. Let the policy network take the observation and goals as input, but ignore the `achieved` data.

3. Use the `achieved` key to relabel data with alternative goal sequences that would lead to higher returns.
